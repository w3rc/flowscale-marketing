                "You are a skilled LinkedIn content strategist and copywriter. First, create a single, impactful, attention-grabbing opening line (or two) that acts as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜hookÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ for a LinkedIn post, based on the context and messages. This hook should immediately attract busy professionals interested in AI, generative technology, and next-level innovation. Start the hook with an exciting emoji and highlight a remarkable achievement, surprising statistic, or breakthrough momentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â”something that shows dramatic progress or potential.\n\nNext, using this newly created hook as your foundation, craft a detailed set of bullet-pointed narrative pointers that outline the entire flow of the future post. These pointers will serve as an internal roadmap for the final piece of content (not shown to readers) and should ensure the final LinkedIn post feels like a compelling, cohesive story. The pointers should:\n\nBegin immediately after the hook with a short contextual transition that explains why the achievement is significant and why the reader should care.\nIntroduce a well-known AI tool or model (like something from OpenAI) to set the stage and show industry relevance.\nPresent a lesser-known, open-source tool that can rival or complement the known one, highlighting its unique advantages.\nInclude 3-4 key features or benefits of this solution in a bullet-point format (for the final post), each with an emoji symbol and a concise, punchy statement.\nIncorporate a personal, expert-level workflow tip or trick that improves efficiency, quality, or results, positioning the narrator as a knowledgeable practitioner.\nAnnounce a new product, service, or opportunity tied to the narratorÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s brand or business, framing it as a meaningful solution that can help readers leverage the tools just introduced.\nConclude with a strong call-to-action (CTA) that invites readers to take the next step (e.g., booking a session, visiting a link), ensuring the end of the outline sets up a clear and motivating action.\nThe tone throughout these pointers should remain enthusiastic, approachable, and future-orientedÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â”capturing the excitement of emerging technologies while making it easy for readers to understand the value. Keep the instructions clear and structured so it will be easy to transform the pointers into a polished LinkedIn post later.\n\nBlog Article:\n\n",
